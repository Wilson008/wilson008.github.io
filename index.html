			  I am a software engineer, mainly working in C++ and Java, but I am also familiar with C# WPF, QT, Python, etc., as well as working on Windows OS and VxWorks OS. 
			  I have more than 7 years of software development experience and some large-scale industrial control projects.
			</p>
			<p>
			  I am also a PhD student, and my research field is Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Currently, I am mainly working on domain-specific language (DSL) related research.
			</p>
			<p>
			  Since I have six years of experience in the field of railway signaling (3 years as a master's student and another 3 years as a software engineer), I have extensive expertise in the field of railway signaling.

            <p>
              I am a PhD student with 7 years of experience in industry. 
			  I worked as a software engineer (4 years) and as a project manager (three years).
			  Now I am working as a doctoral researcher in the field of model-driven software engineering (MDSE).
            </p>
            <p>
              My research area is <strong>model-driven engineering (MDE)</strong>. Currently, I mainly work on <strong>domain-specific language (DSL)</strong> related research, such as optimizing grammars generated from meta-models.
			  Addtionally, I had studied and worked in the field of railway signaling system for 7 years (2010~2016). Although I did not publish academic papers during this period, I have rich engineering experience and large project experience in railway signaling systems. Therefore, I think railway signaling system is also my research area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like all other software engineers, I have experience with several programming languages and platforms. I once coded and am coding in: 
              <strong>C, C++ (including QT and MFC), C# (including WPF), Java</strong>, etc.
			  And worked in <strong>VxWorks, Windows</strong>, Linux OS.
            </p>
			<p>
			  As I mentioned above, I have extensive experience in the field of <strong>railway signaling systems</strong>. 
			  I developed embedded application software for the automatic train operation system (<strong>ATO</strong>) of <strong>China's high-speed trains</strong>, and also developed driving assistant systems for <strong>China's heavy-haul trains</strong>. 
			  I am familiar with <strong>CBTC</strong> and familiar with standards such as EN50126, IEEE1474 standards, etc. 
			  I once led my team to obtain the TUV German Rheinland certificate and the British Lloyd's certification.

          <p>
            BUMBLE aims at providing an innovative system and software development framework based on blended modelling notations/languages (e.g. textual and graphical). 
			The framework provides automatic generation and management of fully-fledged blended modelling environments from arbitrary DSMLs. 
			Blended modelling environments are expected to greatly boost the development of complex multi-domain systems by enabling seamless textual and graphical collaborative modelling.

          <!--<strong>Public Key Appliance (PKA)</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            I developed Public Key Appliance (PKA) in 2010. At that time,
            running a public key infrastructure was so hard to do. A customer
            needs multiple servers, Hardware Security Modules (HSM), backup
            solutions, database servers, special enterprise applications for
            Certificate Authority, Registration Authority, OCSP Responders, CRL
            Publishers, etc. So, I created an "appliance" that integrates all
            required software and hardware parts in one module. Since I used a
            custom-built Linux operating system with an internal HSM from
            SafeNet, it was secure and fast. We established a startup company
            (PKI Co.) based on this product and sold many of them. I also
            patented PKA in Iran (our target market), winning prizes and startup
            festivals. My co-founders and I created a talented engineering team,
            and I left them in 2016 to immigrate to the US. :-|
