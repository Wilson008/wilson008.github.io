            <p>
              I am a PhD student with 7 years of experience in industry. 
			  I worked as a software engineer (4 years) and as a project manager (three years).
			  Now I am working as a doctoral researcher in the field of model-driven software engineering (MDSE).
            </p>
            <p>
              My interests are model-driven software engineering (MDSE), Domain-Specific Language (DSL), and Railway Signaling System.
              Currently, I'm working on grammar optimization technology on textual DSLs and a language workbench that utilizes it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like all other software engineers, I have experience with several
              programming languages and platforms. I once coded and am coding in: 
              <strong>C, C++ (including QT and MFC), C# (including WPF), Java</strong>, etc.
			  And worked in <strong>VxWorks, Linux, Windows</strong> OS.
            </p>
			<p>
			  I have extensive experience in the field of <strong>railway signaling systems</strong>. 
			  I developed embedded application software for the automatic train operation system (<strong>ATO</strong>) of <strong>China's high-speed trains</strong>, and also developed driving assistant systems for <strong>China's heavy-haul trains</strong>. 
			  I am familiar with subway signaling systems and familiar with EN50126, IEEE1474 standards, etc. 
			  I once led my team to obtain the German Rheinland certificate and the British Lloyd's certification.

          <p>
            BUMBLE aims at providing an innovative system and software development framework based on blended modelling notations/languages (e.g. textual and graphical). 
			The framework provides automatic generation and management of fully-fledged blended modelling environments from arbitrary DSMLs. 
			Blended modelling environments are expected to greatly boost the development of complex multi-domain systems by enabling seamless textual and graphical collaborative modelling.

          <!--<strong>Public Key Appliance (PKA)</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            I developed Public Key Appliance (PKA) in 2010. At that time,
            running a public key infrastructure was so hard to do. A customer
            needs multiple servers, Hardware Security Modules (HSM), backup
            solutions, database servers, special enterprise applications for
            Certificate Authority, Registration Authority, OCSP Responders, CRL
            Publishers, etc. So, I created an "appliance" that integrates all
            required software and hardware parts in one module. Since I used a
            custom-built Linux operating system with an internal HSM from
            SafeNet, it was secure and fast. We established a startup company
            (PKI Co.) based on this product and sold many of them. I also
            patented PKA in Iran (our target market), winning prizes and startup
            festivals. My co-founders and I created a talented engineering team,
            and I left them in 2016 to immigrate to the US. :-|

          <a><strong>Team-programmering</strong></a>
		  <br />
          <p>            
			The course introduces the students the theories, concepts and practices of project management and software development projects. 
			The course focuses on project management, the process of creating software, the skill of programming and working together as a team towards a common goal.
          </p>
		  <p>
		    The purpose of this course is to give the students an introduction to the project management area and the tools and techniques used to manage software development projects. 
			The course introduces the students to the human element and discusses people, personalities and dynamics and the way in which they have an impact on IT projects. 
			Areas such as cost estimation, risk management, and project evaluation are also discussed.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    - I was a teaching assistant for this course in both 2020 Autumn and 2021 Autumn.
		  </p>
		  
		  <a><strong>Software Language Engineering for Domain-Specific Languages</strong></a>
		  <br />
          <p>            
			- Standard visual modeling languages, such as UML, taken out of the box, often do not fit an organization's needs. 
			Extending modeling languages with necessary constructs and features, or creating complementary languages, requires specialist knowledge beyond that of software modeling. 
			The purpose of this course is for the student to get familiarized with contemporary technologies and notations for the creation, adaptation, and transformation of modeling languages.
          </p>
		  <p>            
			- I was a teaching assistant for this course in both 2021 Spring and 2022 Spring.

		  <a><strong>Software Architecture</strong></a>
		  <br />
          <p>            
			- The aim of this course is to equip students with basic knowledge and skills about software architecture design and its role in the development and maintenance of software systems. 
			The Mantra for this course is Authentic Quality, we expect authentic learning and authentic original deliverables, with best possible quality. 
			This course covers various definitions of software architecture. 
			We discuss the role and relevance of software architecture at different stages of development projects; 
			we discuss the relation of architecture to requirements and system implementation; 
			we discuss software architecture quality attributes; 
			we discuss various architectural styles and tactics; 
			we discuss general software design principles; 
			we discuss how to document and how to evaluate software architectures. 
			Moreover, we also draw attention to practical market needs, stakeholders, and the economy of software architecture.
          </p>
		  <p>            
			- I was a teaching assistant for this course in 2022 Autumn.
          </p>
		  
		  <a><strong>Software evolution project</strong></a>
		  <br />
          <p>            
			- The aim of this course is for students to synthesize and apply the knowledge achieved from previous compulsory courses in the program, and learn about and deal with the activities occurring after the initial product release in software development. 
			The purpose of this course is to familiarize the student with situations, activities, and techniques typical for software evolution, such as adding a new feature, refactoring, automating variability or testing, improving performance, re-balancing non-functional requirements, and so on. 
			Furthermore, students learn to plan, implement, and reflect on software evolution scenarios and improvements.
          </p>
          <p>            
			- I am a teaching assistant for this course in 2023 Autumn.
